# Blade Registry

The Blade Registry is a directory service implemented as a smart contract in Ethereum/Solidity. The smart contract is (loosely) based on [EiP 1056](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1056), allowing any identity on Ethereum to register an identity for the use in the [Blade ecosystem](https://github.com/blade-net).
